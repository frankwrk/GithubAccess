# Github Data Visualization
This project is part of CS3012 Coursework, Trinity College Dublin.
The aim is to interrogate the Github API and fetch data that could be useful in elucidating aspects of the software engineer process. The course requires the data to be used in some sort of visualization.

## Technologies used
1. React
2. D3
3. Node.js
4. NPM

### [React](https://reactjs.org/)
React is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library used for building interfaces.
I used React both for the frontend and fetching the data, with the built-in fetch command.

### [D3](https://d3js.org/)
D3 is another JavaScript library. It's used to build interactive, dynamic web visualization.
I used this library to create a Force-Directed Graph.
